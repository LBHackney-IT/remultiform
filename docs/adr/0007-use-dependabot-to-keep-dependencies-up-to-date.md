# 7. Use Dependabot to keep dependencies up to date

Date: 2019-10-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to ensure all dependencies stay up to date. Dependabot offers a service
where a bot opens PRs on GitHub when new versions of dependencies are released.

## Decision

We will use Dependabot to monitor dependency updates.

## Consequences

Using Dependabot means we don't need to manually monitor dependencies for new
versions.
