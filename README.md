# Remultiform

The **Re**act **multi**page **form** builder

**Warning: Remultiform is still in alpha. No promises of API stability are
made.**

## Running the tests

To run the full test suite, including building:

## Architecture decision records

We use ADRs to document architecture decisions that we make. They can be found
in `docs/adr` and contributed to with
[adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
